MATLAB & Fortran analysis tooling for cars data.

## Layout

### Main tools
- `src/matlab/carsft`  – Matlab source for CARSFT functions
- `src/matlab/+cfx` - Matlab interface for Fortran carsfit (CO2/2pump)
- `src/fortran/co2_2pump` - Fortran-based carsfit (CO2/2pump)
- `src/fortran/co2_2pump/data` - Data files for the fortran-based exe
- `src/python/carsfit-tools` - Python utilities for carsfit (e.g. plotting)

### Tests
- `tests/matlab/carsft` – Tests of CARSFT Matlab codes
- `tests/matlab/cfx` - Tests of the interface to Fortran carsfit (CO2/2pump)
- `tests/fortran/co2_2pump` - Tests for the CO2/dual pump code

------------------

## Using the CARS Analysis Suite


### Get the code:

Obtain the suite of CARS analysis tools with the following command
from your terminal:

```bash
mkdir ~/CHESS-CARS-ANALYSIS
cd ~/CHESS-CARS-ANALYSIS
git clone https://github.com/chess-uiuc/cars-analysis
cd cars-analysis
```

-----------------------

### How to use the Matlab code

Do the following inside of `Matlab`:

```matlab
% Navigate to the top level directory of the cars-analysis suite:
cd ~/CHESS-CARS-ANALYSIS/cars-analysis

% Add all MATLAB source folders to the path:
addpath(genpath('src/matlab'))

% Run the full MATLAB test suite
runtests('tests/matlab/carsft')
```

You can inspect, and change the `carsft` tests by looking in:
`tests/matlab/carsft/*.m`

You can inspect, and change `carsft` code by looking in:
`src/matlab/carsft/src/*.m`

### How to use the FORTRAN `carsfit_co2`

0) You need a FORTRAN compiler to build `carsfit_co2`

If you do not have a FORTRAN compiler, you'll need to install
one.  If you already have one, then one of these commands should
tell you if you have a common one:

```bash
which gfortran
which f90
which f77
which ifort
echo $FC
```

If none of those commands indicate you have a FORTRAN compiler
then try the following:

  - MAC: `brew install gcc` ([More details](https://www.google.com/search?q=install+gfortran+on+mac))
  - Ubuntu Linux: `aptget install gcc` ([Other Linux](https://www.google.com/search?q=install+gfortran+on+linux))
  - Windows: ([Try this](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+gcc+on+windows&oq=how+to+install+gcc+on+windows))

[Here's some more information about installing a FORTRAN compiler on different systems.](https://fortran-lang.org/learn/os_setup/install_gfortran/)

1) Build the `carsfit_co2` executable from FORTRAN code

This command **builds** the executable:

```bash
make -C src/fortran/co2_2pump
```

Then this command runs some tests to make sure it "works":

```bash
tests/fortran/co2_2pump/smoke/run_smoke.sh
```

2) Run `carsft`:

Examples of the required input files `cars.mol`, `cars.par`, `co2.mol`
can be found in the `data` directory.  In this example, we copy that
directory to the `testrun` directory as a demo.

```bash
cd src/fortran/co2_2pump
cp -r data testrun
cd testrun
../bin/carsfit_co2
```

If the run is successful, at least one dataset will be created:

```bash
ls -l pltchi_*.*
```

You should see something like this:

```
-rw-r--r--  1 mtcampbe  staff   220006 Dec 16 10:18 pltchi_0001.csv
-rw-r--r--  1 mtcampbe  staff       89 Dec 16 10:18 pltchi_0001.meta
```

The data to plot is in the CSV file, and a human-readable meta data
file explains what data can be found in the CSV.

3) Plot results:

A python utility is provided to plot the resulting data. It automatically
reads the meta data file for the axis labels, if it exists.

```bash
python ../../../python/carsfit-tools/plot_carsfit_csv.py pltchi_0001.csv
```

If you do not have `python` on your system, here is some info about how
to install python on [Mac](https://www.google.com/search?q=install+python+on+mac), [Linux](https://www.google.com/search?q=install+python+on+linux), and [Windows](https://www.google.com/search?q=install+python+on+windows).

### How to use the Matlab interface to FORTRAN `carsfit_co2`

1) Build or obtain the binary (See HOWTO build FORTRAN `carsfit_co2` above):

The build process (or an executable you otherwise obtain) must be located at and named:

`src/fortran/co2_2pump/bin/carsfit_co2`

2) In MATLAB:

```matlab
% If you didnt already do this, add the matlab path
addpath(genpath('src/matlab'));

% Run carsfit_co2 from MATLAB (8 Enters, then N, N)
seq = [repmat("",8,1); "N"; "N"];
out = cfx.run_carsfit_script(seq, struct('workdir',"runs/demo1"));

% Load and plot the primary CSV
T = out.tables(out.primary_csv);
figure; plot(T{:,1}, T{:,2}, 'LineWidth', 1.2); grid on; xlabel('X'); ylabel('Y');

% Optional: generate a PNG plot via the Python tool
R = cfx.plot_csv_with_python(fullfile(out.workdir, out.primary_csv));
disp("PNG saved as " + R.png_out);
```
